# File Attributes
### chown command
- Change the ownership for the darey file to **dare** as user, and **developers** as group
  
- Create a new directory called docs, copy the dummy-doc file into this directory and change the ownership for the docs directory and its content to **dare** as user, and **developers** as group (Hint: You could pass the -R flag to chown)
  
- Change the user permissions on the darey file to read only for the all three entities (user, group and others)
  
- Add write permissions for user only

- Add execute permissions for all three entities
  
- Revoke execute permissions for others from the docs directory (you don't want other people to have access to your private docs right?)
