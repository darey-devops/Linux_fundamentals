Syntax to set a password is `passwd <new_user>`

Input a password you will remember easily. Do not worry that you cannot see what you type. This is silent(what the behaviour is called in Linux) because of security purposes.


`passwd testing`{{execute}}



***Note: Use `sudo` at the start of your command if you get an error message***
